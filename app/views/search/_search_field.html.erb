  <h1>Review GOV.UK search results</h1>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Help us to improve GOV.UK by scoring our search results.
    We will use your scores to improve the relevance of future search results.
    Score as many results as you like. The more scores we get, the better GOV.UK will be.

        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Perfect</h4>
        <p>
          Based on your search term, the result is completely relevant. More than one result can be perfect.
        </p>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Good</h4>
        <p>
          The result is clearly reasonable. You are not surprised that the search term brought back this result.
        </p>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">OK</h4>
        <p>
          You can see why we returned the result, but it isn't very helpful. For example, a search for
          “Find my local council” may return a page about how to pay a parking charge to your local council. You can see why it appeared
          (because it includes a reference to local councils) but it isn’t directly relevant for your search term.
        </p>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Bad</h4>
        <p>
          The result has no apparent relationship to your search term.
